# my-swiggy.in-usage

`all_orders.json` contains all (516) my orders placed through Swiggy.in (Indian food delivery start-up). 
I will get to it at some point to run analytics – but if this excites you, go ahead do data-sci :) Pull-requests are welcome! 

## Insights
* How often do I eat out? (Almost all the time)
* What times do I eat lunch & dinner? What's the variance like? 
* Approximately, what's the nutrition value of my average meals? (Assuming, I've had all the food I've order.)
* Classify items from each order into "healthy" or "junk" and show stats. 
* Based on my orders, build a recommendation system that understands dishes at ingredient level, uses environment conditions to make suggestions (dish level). This should scale for new dishes too.
* Can you come-up with insights related to my location history? 

## Privacy
* All personally identifiable information (viz., firends' names/ house addresses etc) are obsolete. 
* Financial markers are obsolete too.
* So, I feel comfortable sharing my date – however, be responsible with it.
